# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

## Current Issue: README File Showing Instead of App

If you're seeing the README file content on `https://y1jeong.github.io/` instead of the React application, this means GitHub Pages is configured to serve from the repository root instead of using the GitHub Actions workflow.

## Solution Steps:

## 1. Configure GitHub Pages Source

**CRITICAL:** You must change the source from "Deploy from a branch" to "GitHub Actions"

1. Go to your repository: `https://github.com/y1jeong/y1jeong.github.io`
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section in the left sidebar
4. Under **Build and deployment** â†’ **Source**, select **GitHub Actions** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
5. Save the settings

**Why this matters:** <mcreference link="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48919200/github-pages-only-showing-readme-file" index="1">1</mcreference> When GitHub Pages is set to "Deploy from a branch", it looks for an index.html file in the repository root. If none exists, it displays the README.md file instead.

## 2. Trigger the GitHub Actions Workflow

The workflow should automatically run when you push to the main branch. You can also:

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Find the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Click **Run workflow** to manually trigger it

## 3. Wait for Deployment

- The workflow takes a few minutes to complete
- Once successful, your site will be available at `https://y1jeong.github.io/`
- Check the Actions tab for any errors if the deployment fails

## 4. Verify the Fix

After changing to GitHub Actions:
1. The workflow should automatically run
2. Check the **Actions** tab for "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow status
3. Once successful, `https://y1jeong.github.io/` should show your React app
4. If you still see the README, wait 5-10 minutes for DNS propagation

## 5. Troubleshooting

- **Still seeing README?** Double-check that Source is set to "GitHub Actions" (not "Deploy from a branch")
- Ensure the repository name is exactly `y1jeong.github.io`
- Make sure the repository is public
- Check that the workflow file `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` exists
- Verify that the build output is in `src/frontend/dist/`
- Look for errors in the Actions tab workflow runs

## Technical Background

<mcreference link="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site" index="4">4</mcreference> GitHub Pages now uses GitHub Actions to execute builds. When using "Deploy from a branch", GitHub looks for index.html, index.md, or README.md as the entry file. <mcreference link="https://docs.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually" index="5">5</mcreference> Since our React app's built files are generated by the workflow and placed in the deployment artifact, we need to use "GitHub Actions" as the source.

The `.nojekyll` file has been added to prevent Jekyll processing, ensuring our React app's routing works correctly.

## Note

For user GitHub Pages sites (like `username.github.io`), the repository must be named exactly `username.github.io` and the content is served from the root path.
