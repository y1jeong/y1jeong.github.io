# MEMORY.md - RhinoPerforatedWall Project

## Project Overview
Web application for generating customized perforated panels based on user-uploaded halftone pattern images.

## Date: 2024-12-19

### Initial Project Setup
- Created empty project structure
- Starting development of web application with the following requirements:
  - User input: Panel size in imperial units (inches), halftone pattern image upload (JPEG, PNG, SVG)
  - Perforation generation: Automatic analysis of grayscale/contrast to perforation density and size
  - Customization: Perforation shapes (circles, rectangles, polygons, custom vectors), spacing, distribution patterns
  - Real-time preview: Interactive preview with zoom, pan, rotate
  - Output generation: DXF, SVG, PDF formats for CNC/laser cutting
  - User account management for saving/retrieving designs
  - Responsive UI for desktop, tablet, mobile

### Technology Stack Decisions
- Frontend: React.js with TypeScript for type safety
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js
- Database: MongoDB for user accounts and design storage
- Image Processing: Canvas API and custom algorithms for halftone analysis
- File Generation: Libraries for DXF, SVG, PDF output
- Authentication: JWT-based user authentication

### Frontend Development Progress
- ✅ Created complete React.js frontend structure with TypeScript
- ✅ Set up Vite build system with Tailwind CSS for styling
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive UI component library:
  - Button component with multiple variants (default, destructive, outline, secondary, ghost, link)
  - Input component with label, error, and helper text support
  - Card components for content containers
  - Layout components (Header, Sidebar, Footer) with responsive design
- ✅ Created complete page structure:
  - Home page with hero section, features, testimonials, and statistics
  - Authentication pages (Login, Register) with form validation
  - Design studio page with canvas-based design tools
  - Gallery page for browsing and managing saved designs
  - Profile page for user account management
  - Settings page for application configuration
- ✅ Implemented routing structure with protected and public routes
- ✅ Set up development server successfully running on http://localhost:3000/
- ✅ Created utility functions for common operations (class merging, file handling, etc.)

### Technical Implementation Details
- Used `class-variance-authority` (cva) for component variant styling
- Integrated Lucide React for consistent iconography
- Fixed button functionality issues by implementing proper React Router structure
- Resolved React Query dependency error by adding QueryClientProvider wrapper

### Recent Fixes (Latest Session)

  - Fixed backend package.json dependencies (corrected dxf-writer and svg.js package names)
  - Created simplified backend server (server-simple.js) to bypass TypeScript compilation issues
  - Started backend server on port 5000 with mock authentication endpoints
  - Registration now works correctly with backend API communication
- ✅ **Button Functionality Fix**: Updated App.tsx from basic HTML structure to proper React Router setup
  - Replaced plain HTML button with functional routing and context providers
  - Implemented proper component hierarchy: QueryClientProvider > ThemeProvider > AuthProvider > Router
  - All buttons now work correctly with onClick handlers and navigation
- ✅ **React Query Integration**: Added QueryClientProvider to resolve "No QueryClient set" error
  - AuthContext was using React Query hooks but missing the provider
  - Configured QueryClient with appropriate default options (retry: 1, staleTime: 5 minutes)
- ✅ **Development Server**: Successfully running on http://localhost:3001/ with no errors
- ✅ **Application Structure**: Full routing system now functional with all pages accessible
- Fixed tailwindcss-animate dependency issue by installing missing package

### Issues Resolved
- **Tailwind CSS Configuration Error**: Resolved "Cannot find module 'tailwindcss-animate'" error by installing the missing `tailwindcss-animate` package. The error was occurring in the Tailwind configuration file which was trying to require this plugin for animations.
- **Development Server Stability**: After installing the missing dependency, the development server now runs without CSS compilation errors.
- Implemented responsive design patterns with Tailwind CSS
- Set up proper TypeScript configuration for type safety
- Created modular component architecture for maintainability

### TypeScript Error Resolution (Completed)
- **Issue**: Frontend build failing with 17+ TypeScript errors in `hybridApi.ts`
- **Root Cause**: Missing required `message` properties in `ApiResponse` objects and type mismatches
- **Solution Applied**:
  - Added missing `message` properties to all static deployment responses in hybrid API functions
  - Fixed type casting for `authApi.changePassword` and `authApi.logout` to match expected `ApiResponse<void>`
  - Corrected `designsApi.getAll` return type handling from `PaginatedResponse<Design>` to `Design[]`
  - Updated all user management functions (`promoteUser`, `demoteUser`, `getAllUsers`, etc.) with proper response structure
  - Removed unused `apiClient` import to eliminate warning
- **Result**: Build now completes successfully with exit code 0, all TypeScript errors resolved
- **Files Modified**: `src/frontend/src/lib/hybridApi.ts`
- **Impact**: Frontend can now build and deploy without TypeScript compilation errors
